# Bored ENS Yacht Club 🦍

Bored ENS Yacht Club (BENSYC) is the first ENS 10k subdomain collection where the subdomain NFT is your membership to the club.

# What is the Purpose & Vision of BENSYC?

BENSYC's primary purpose is to provide the ENS community with a light-weight, experimental ENS subdomain project that has sufficient features for the holders to form a sub-DAO within ENS. Upon reaching full functionality, BENSYC sub-DAO will enable the holders to vote as a single delegate within ENS DAO. In addition to ENS DAO education & voting, BENSYC aims to explore experimental ENS use cases - especially of ENS subdomains, and potentially support the ENS builders through BENSYC grants.

# How Will Minting Work?

A collection of **10,000** Bored ENS Yacht Club subdomain NFTs (0-9999) with an array of name-bound features will be available to mint at a price of 0.01 ETH each on **Sept 9, 2022 12:00 UTC**.

# What Are Name-Bound Tokens?

BENSYC drop will consist of an NFT (including an avatar) + `boredensyachtclub.eth` subdomain + `bensyc.eth` subdomain that are all mutually name-bound. Name-bound tokens are similar to soul-bound tokens in the sense that tokens are bound to ENS names instead of wallets. The owner can freely sell/transfer the NFT and the two subdomains will automatically be transferred with the NFT to the new owner along with all the metadata (e.g. avatar, decentralized website).

# What is BENSYC Community Treasury?

BENSYC Community Treasury is the 3/4 multi-sig managed by the founders at the start of the project. In due time as project matures, the treasury will be migrated to the sub-DAO governor contract. 50% of all proceeds from the mint will be transferred to the community treasury and converted to ENS tokens to be delegated to BENSYC. The remaining 50% of all proceeds from the mint will be held as ETH in the community treasury for long term sustainability of BENSYC and ongoing development.

# Do the Subdomains Have Their Own Websites?

Yes, each BENSYC subdomain will have its own automatically generated decentralized website.

# What is $🧪?

BENSYC is experimenting with the use cases of fractionalizing ENS domain ownership to create community tokens. `🦍coin.eth` has been fractionalized into 1 billion `$🦍` tokens and `$🦍` tokens collectively own `🦍coin.eth`. `🦍coin.eth` can be purchased by anyone & will start with a purchase price of 10,000 ETH. Holders of `$🦍` tokens will have a right to vote on the purchase price of `🦍coin.eth`. Upon conclusion of BENSYC 10k subdomain mints, 50% of `$🦍` will be airdropped to the BENSYC subdomain owners through a 'claim process' (similar to the ENS token airdrop) and 50% of `$🦍` will go to the BENSYC community treasury. BENSYC subdomain holders may vote to use the community treasury as a source of grants for builders from the ENS community. If `🦍coin.eth` is bought out, then `$🦍` will become pegged to the purchase price and `$🦍` holders will be able to swap `$🦍` for the proportional share of ETH from the `🦍coin.eth` buyout.

Pssss... Upon BENSYC 10k subdomain mints, the founding team might have an additional surprise 🧪. You didn't hear it from us.
